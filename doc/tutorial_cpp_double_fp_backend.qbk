The `cpp_double_fp_backend` back-end is the sum of two IEEE floating-point numbers
combined to create a type having rougly twice the composite width of one of its parts.
The `cpp_double_fp_backend` back-end is used in conjunction with `number`
and acts as an entirely C++ header only floating-point number type.

The `cpp_double_fp_backend` types have fixed width and do not allocate.
The type `cpp_double_double`, for instance, (composed of two double-precision IEEE floating-point numebers)
has (on most common systems) 106 binary digits of precision and approximately
32 decimal digits of precision.

The exponent ranges of the types are slightly limited (on the negative side) compared to those of the composite type.
Consider again the type `cpp_double_double`, composed of two double-precision IEEE double-precision
floating-point numebers. On common systems, this type has a maximum decimal exponent of 308
(as does a single double-precision floating point number). The negative minimum exponent, however,
is about -291, which is less range than the -307 from standalone double. The reason for
the limitation is because the composite lower-limb has lower value than its upper limb and would
underflow or become subnormal if the upper limb had its usual minimum value.

There is full standard library and `std::numeric_limits` support available for this type.

Note that the availability of `cpp_double_float128` depends on the availability
of `boost::float128_type`, which can be queried at compile-time via the
configuration macro `BOOST_HAS_FLOAT128`. This is available at the moment
predominantly with GCC compilers in GNU-standard mode and (with GCC 14 and later)
also in strict ANSI mode.

Run-time performance is a top-level requirement for the `cpp_double_fp_backend` types.
The types still do, however, support infinities, NaNs and (of course) zeros.
Signed negative zero, however, is not supported (in favor of efficiency)
and all zeros are treated as positive.

The `cpp_double_fp_backend` types inoteroperate with Boost.Math and Boost.Math.Constants.
This offers the wealth of Boost-related mathematical tools instantiated with
the `cpp_double_fp_backend` types.

Things you should know when using the `cpp_double_fp_backend` types:

* Although the types are created from two individual IEEE floating-point components, they specifically and clearly are not IEEE types in their composite forms.
* As a result these types can behave subtly differently from IEEE floating-point types.
* There are `std::numeric_limits` specializations for these types.
* Large parts (but not all) of the `cpp_double_fp_backend` implementation are `constexpr`.
* Conversion to and from string internally uses an  intermediate `cpp_dec_float` value (which may be eliminated in future refinements).

The `cpp_double_fp_backend` back-end has been inspired by original works and types such as the historical `doubledouble`
and more. These include the following:
